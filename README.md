# Micro Center Website Revamp


# 1. Project Overview, Introduction and Requirements specification


The purpose of this final project is to showcase skills and competencies developed over the duration of two years in the CWEB program at Dunwoody.

## 1.1. Introduction


## 1.2. Project Overview
A revamping of Micro Center's website. Outdated visual elements such as the bland color scheme & mismatching button shapes and colors will be replaced with modern web styling, giving new life to a website that looks like it hadn't been updated since the 90s.

New website will have a mobile-first approach to design, with touch-responsive elements.

## 1.3. Project Scope
### 1.3.1 Features the project _must_ implement
 - Project must use a database (not hard coded values within html code)
 - Project must demonstrate the use of a configuration file outside of the code (an application.ini file or web.config)
 - Project must use a secure algorithm to hash the password (either system default or one of the modern hashing algorithms with salt like bcrypt or SHA-512/224 - DO NOT USE md5 or SHA-1 or 2)
 - Project must use parameterized queries [NO concatenated strings for queries]
 - Project must encrypt user sensitive data [using a secure algorithm for encryption like AES or blowfish/twofish]

 - Responsive (mobile first) design
 - Use a color palette/theme that is familiar to existing customers
 - Retain the functions that are currently available to guests and registered users
 - Payment platform to diversify payment options

### 1.3.2 Features the project _should_ implement
 - Project should function in a hosted environment
 - Project code should be in a github or other online repository

 - Use transitions for improved UI/UX
 - Grab user's IP address for cookie purposes
 - Prompt for and store user's location
 - Ability for user to switch between day/night modes to cater to early bird and night owl shoppers
 - Get time user's time zone for day/night mode

### 1.3.3 Features the project _could_ implement
 - Check for electronic payment methods

### 1.3.4 Features the project _will not_ implement
 - Users will not be able to use this as a full replacement for the original website
